PCB files for two Adafruit Feather/FeatherWing on one PCB (side by side)

# Description

Two Feather/FeatherWing can be placed side by side on this board.

The Doubler 1X2, has a tripple duplicate breakout for each pin on a Feather, as well as a bunch of plain grid development holes. Also, the three sets of pins are cross connected and for GND(- or black) and 3.3V(+ or red), they give you a full strip of connected pads.
